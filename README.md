ForeTiS-HortiCo: A Forecasting Time Series framework for Horticultural Sales
=============================================================================
ForeTiS-HortiCo is a Python framework that enables the rigorous training, comparison and analysis of time series forecasting for a variety of different models.
ForeTiS includes multiple state-of-the-art prediction models or machine learning methods, respectively. 
These range from classical models, such as regularized linear regression over ensemble learners, e.g. XGBoost, to deep learning-based architectures, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 
To enable automatic hyperparameter optimization, we leverage state-of-the-art and efficient Bayesian optimization techniques. 
In addition, our framework is designed to allow an easy and straightforward integration of further prediction models.
